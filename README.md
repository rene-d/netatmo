# netatmo.py

**Important**: due to changes made by Netatmo to authentication, this project is no longer functional and will not be updated. 

Please fork it and update it, or use another library, like [netatmo-api-python](https://github.com/philippelt/netatmo-api-python).

*Original README follows...*

Python 3 API to retrieve data from the Netatmo connected [weather station](https://www.netatmo.com/product/weather/).

The library implements the [authentication](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/guides/authentication/clientcredentials), the [token refresh](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/guides/authentication/refreshingatoken) and the both weather station methods [Getstationdata](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/reference/weatherstation/getstationsdata) and [Getmeasure](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/reference/common/getmeasure).

Although Netatmo provides [samples](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/samplessdks/codesamples#) written in Python, this library provides - I hope! - more high level methods to access the data.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the library is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
```bash
pip3 install netatmo
```

You can also download or clone the GitHub repository and install the module:
```bash
cd /path/to/repo
python3 setup.py install
```

Finally, you may get the [netatmo.py](https://github.com/rene-d/netatmo/blob/master/src/netatmo/netatmo.py) source file and use it in your projects.


## Requirements

* Python 3 (sorry if you live in [legacy](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3))
* The [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) module (should be included in any decent Python distribution)
* A valid Netatmo account with at least one weather station
* A client\_id / client\_secret pair from Netatmo developper program (see [Create your app](https://dev.netatmo.com/apps/createanapp))

## Command-line usage

### Help

```bash
netatmo -h
netatmo <command> -h
```

where `<command>` can be one of these keywords: `config`, `fetch`, `list`, `test`, `dump`.

### Credentials

The library reads the username/password and client id/secret from a .rc file. By default, it is ~/.netatmorc. It could be edited by hand, or written by the library with the `config` command.

```bash
netatmo config -u user@mail -p password -i client_id -s client_secret -d 70:ee:50:xx:xx:xx
````

Without any option, `config` only prints the current configuration.

    $ netatmo config
    Read config
    username: user@mail
    password: password
    client_id: 1234567890abcdef12345678
    client_secret: ABCdefg123456hijklmn7890pqrs
    default_station: 70:ee:50:xx:xx:xx

### Display the authorized stations

    netatmo list

### Fetch data into CSV files

    netatmo fetch

This command will write two CSV files, `netatmo_station.csv` and `netatmo_module.csv`. The most recent measures are appended to these files depending on the last timestamps.

### Other commands and options

`test` tests the connection. On success, exit code is zero. On failure, non zero, like any shell command.

`dump` displays more data from the weather station.

Each option `-v` increases the verbosity. The option `-c` can be use to use an alternate configuration file.

Both `-v` and `-c` have to be placed before the command.

## Usage as a Python module

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3

import netatmo

# fetch data using ~/.netatmorc credentials
netatmo.fetch()

# credentials as parameters
ws = netatmo.WeatherStation( {
        'client_id': '1234567890abcdef12345678',
        'client_secret': 'ABCdefg123456hijklmn7890pqrs',
        'username': 'user@mail',
        'password': 'password',
        'device': '70:ee:50:XX:XX:XX' } )
ws.get_data()
print(ws.devices)
```

## License and warranty

None and none.

It is NOT an official software from Netatmo and it is not endorsed or supported by this company.

This library has been written as a personal work. Feel free to improve or adapt it to your own needs.

## Notes

### Other Netatmo devices

This library has been tested only with the weather station and its interior module. I don't know if it works well with the windgauge or the pluviometer. Other devices are unsupported, but their methods could be easily added. See [Netatmo Connect APIs](https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/reference).

### Installation on a Synology NAS

Synology provides a Python 3 package that lacks the [requests](http://python-requests.org/) module. Here is an simple download method, without git, pip or setup.py:

```bash
curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/v2.20.0 | tar -xzf - --strip-components=1 --wildcards '*/requests'
```

Alternately, you can use [Anaconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) as Python3 distribution.
